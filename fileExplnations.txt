// each folder will run from own directory on own terminal to demo exploit
// complie and run instructions in each folder

PLANS:

1. all log statments will be changed from log() to DEBUG && log() and use env varible like pavol

Folder Server
    -log.hpp
    -log.cpp
    -server.hpp
    -server.cpp
    -secretHashes (a hash on each line for the secrets)
    -hashOfHashes (a hash of the secrect hashes file)

This folder contains the code to start server to interact with

Folder Client
    -log.hpp
    -log.cpp
    -client.hpp
    -client.cpp

This folder contains the code to run a client as intended to interact with server.
The exploit is impossible with the functioning clinet

Folder Exploit (Python or c++ option)
    -createUsers (create 100 users with random username password secrets)
    -stealSecrets (run exploit and steal all the secrets and overwrite with HACKED)
    -secretHashes (a hash on each line for the secrets)
    -hashOfHashes (a hash of the secrect hashes file)

This folder contains code to demo exploit (CURRENTLY NOTHING)

DEMO

1. Start server
2. Show normal client interaction
3. Create random users 
4. Show they exist on the server
5. Hash the secrets on the server
6. Run exploit
7. Show all the secrets on the server contain hacked
8. Hash the secrets in the Expliot folder 
9. Show the hashes match
10. Explain the exploit
